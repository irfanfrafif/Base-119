  headline: Machine Maintenance
  dayInfo: 'A power outage has struck the Skyward Space Station, plunging multiple
    sectors into darkness. Emergency generators are working tirelessly to restore
    electricity, but some systems may remain offline for a while. Maintenance is
    under way.

    

    The maintenance will significantly slow down the operation
    of machines within the station. Trader will need to adapt to limited functionality
    until power is fully restored, requiring them to strategize and manage resources
    efficiently during this crisis.'
