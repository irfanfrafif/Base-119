## Description
It is the year 2210, and the Skywards Space Station (SSS) is opening an exclusive trading post at BASE 119, dedicated to fulfill personal requests of soldiers living at their biggest fleet headquarters. It's not as easy as it sounds, because every day there's always possible dangers during ship's entire daily operations.

As a Merchant, you have to manage the post! 

Watch out for the rush of customer orders, and memorize the crafting guidebook to  quickly sell commodities so you can meet the daily quota. Don't forget, beware of the ship-wide news broadcast about events that may affect your working shift!

## Notes
Code is a total mess because I kinda speedran the whole code in under a week while still learning myself. Feel free to look around but don't expect to see much. I probably will (or won't) rewrite the whole code sometime in the future.
